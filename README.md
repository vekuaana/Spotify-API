# Spotify-API-

Spotify Web API enables the creation of applications that can interact with Spotify's streaming service, such as retrieving content metadata, getting recommendations, creating and managing playlists, or controlling playback (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)

In the following project, we are going to extract data ( the top 10 tracks of any artist) using Python and the Spotify Web API. The steps followed are:

- Create a Client ID and a Client Secret. To do so, follow the step on the Spotify Web API documentation (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps)
- Generate your access token
- Call the request you are interested in. In this exercise, we are going to retrieve the Top 10 most popular songs of a Spotify artist. We will use the Get Artist's Top Tracks request (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-an-artists-top-tracks)
